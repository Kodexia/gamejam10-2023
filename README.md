# GameJam 10-2023

## Overview

A unique botanical defense game where symbiosis is your key to survival! In a world where a lone oxygen-producing flower stands as a beacon of life, you control a devoted robot, bound to the vital range of the flower's life-giving aura. Your mission is to nourish, expand, and defend this floral heart against waves of malevolent robots intent on destruction.

## Features

### Oxygen Dependency

Your robot is tethered to the oxygen zone produced by the central flower and its buds, limiting your range of movement to areas where life thrives.

### Nourish to Flourish

Collect water from ponds that replenish over time to nourish your flower, prompting it to sprout buds and expand the oxygen zone. Nurturing your floral base is crucial, as your operational radius depends on its photosynthetic power!

### Bud Biomes

With each budding event, choose from various bud types - 'Economic' to hasten water regeneration in ponds or 'Defend' to fortify buds against attacks. Future updates promise more bud variations with diverse strategic options.

### Mechanical Marauders

Beware of the evil robots! They spawn with a singular destructive goal - to annihilate your precious buds. While these foes won't target your robot, any bud lost shrinks your lifeline, the vital oxygen zone.

### Tactical Territorial Expansion

Protecting buds and the main flower is your prime directive. As buds mature, they not only extend your roaming radius but also fortify your floral stronghold. Strategic bud placement and type selection are key to your survival and dominance over the terrain.

## Game Objectives

- **Survive**: Maintain your oxygen supply by safeguarding the central flower and its buds.
- **Defend**: Protect your buds from relentless assaults by hostile robots.
- **Expand**: Strategically grow your floral empire to secure more territory and resources.
- **Strategize**: Choose your buds wisely. Each type offers unique advantages that can sway the tide of battle.

## Roadmap

- **More Bud Varieties**: We plan to introduce more bud types with unique abilities, encouraging diverse strategies.
- **Resource Expansion**: Water is essential, but more resources will be added to challenge your resource management skills.
- **Enemy Evolution**: Expect new, tougher enemies that will test your defense strategies to the limit.
